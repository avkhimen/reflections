Using the diff command allowed me to
pinpoint the differences between the two files.
Use "mkdir" to make new directories.

Different version of files allow one to go back in
time if something needs to be corrected.

It think its best to commit after doing
some logical code. But sometimes smaller changes
can be good too.

"git log" logs all the commits for the particular
repository. Use up and down keys to move up
and down within all the commits. Use "q" to
exit the repository.

"git diff commit1 commit2" is the command for
checking the differences between two commit
versions.

To check out the older version of a file
use the "git checkout commit#" and then
navigate to the folder where the file is
to see it.
