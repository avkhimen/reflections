To initialize a new git repository
in the location of your choice navigate
to that location and then type in
"git init". "git status" will give you
the list of the files in that folder.

To add files to staging area use
"git add filename" command. To remove
one of the files from the staging area
use "git reset filename".

The files about to be committed are
stored in what's called the "staging
area".

"git commit" is used to add the commit
to the repository.
"git commit -m 'message'" is used to
add the message for the commit without
opening atom.

"git branch branchname" creates a
branch and instantiates it with name.

"git log --graph
--oneline master branchname"
shows all the commit and the branches.
You'll need to checkout a branch
before making commits in it.

"git checkout -b newbranchname"
creatse a new branch and checks it out.

"git marge branch1 branch2" merges
the 2 branches. Can also checkout 
branch1 and then type in "git merge
branch2" to do the same. If branch1 is
checked out and command "git merge
branch2 branch3" is typed branches 
branch1, branch2, and branch3 will
merge. 

"git log --graph --oneline" displays
the first few symbols in commit id
and the first line of commit title.

You must manually resolve the
changes in code by going directly
to the file and accepting appropriate
changes in order to conclude the
merge process. Read the instructions.
"git commit" message will appear
after you attempt to checkout
the branch and complete the merge. 

"git log -n 1" will display only
one (latest) commit.
