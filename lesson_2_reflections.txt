To initialize a new git repository
in the location of your choice navigate
to that location and then type in
"git init". "git status" will give you
the list of the files in that folder.

To add files to staging area use
"git add filename" command. To remove
one of the files from the staging area
use "git reset filename".

The files about to be committed are
stored in what's called the "staging
area".
